I have been using Visual Studio 2022 with Visual Basic on a Gamer Republican computer.

This is the computer:

Device name	Hector
Processor	AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS w/ Radeon 780M Graphics        4.00 GHz
Installed RAM	48.0 GB (47.2 GB usable)
System type	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
Has Windows 11.

The computer and scaling is really nice for gaming, however Software wise, like Visual Studio 2022 (not Code version), or even photoshop.
I had tried to fix the scaling issue from changeing the computers scaleing issue, but it just made my computer a little wonky after I did it so I set them back to default. 

With Visual Studio 2022, there is a yellow band that appears at the top of the Visual Studio to fix the Scaling issue itself. What its supposed to do is when yoiu click on the band, it will open another Visual Studio document, but it works. However, you have to do this everytime you reload your software, at least according to my observations.  So instead of having two of the saasme documents up, I wrote a script and turning it into a .exe that automatically sets the scale as Visual Studio Opens.  

For the future I will be modifing this Code for multiple Software.
